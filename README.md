# Unrigged-System
-----------  UNDERDEVELOPMENT ----------
# Introduction 
All the games that boast of giving outcomes based on certain winning percentages given before the start of the game have over promised and never certainly devlivered .

Lets take a game with win percentage of 30% . 
The above statements states that for every 100 results , 30 of the results will be in the winners favour and 70% will be not . 
Thats very basic understanding of how these systems tend to boast. 

We can also say that it is a rarity for the systems to give 14 straight losses for the above game situation , if you think 14 losses is a lot , wait unless you see 26 straight losses in a row in a game where there is a win percentage of 30% and we still dont understand why and how this maths work , we could't care less whatsoever . 

Whatever the outcomes be , the outcomes should be entirely in the favour of the player and not of anyone , even if game is not with players side , it still lets the owners take all the money from the player . 
We arent asking for anything that maths wouldn't bring us , we are asking it to deliver what it promised to deliver and in the above case we are asking for a 30% win for every game , we aren't seeking any favourable sides we are just seeking what good maths ought to reach us and deliver us . 
So we ought to introduce a very simple way to deliver only what it promised to deliver and nothing less or nothing more . 
We shall divide all the outcomes , lets say 10,000 outcomes into parts, where each part consisted of 10 elements , and we dont divide them at the end but they are made divided while the outcome is being generated , nothing fancy nothing much just a few lines of baic python code and it tends to promise and deliver just that .
